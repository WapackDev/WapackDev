- 👋 Hi, I’m @WapackDev
- 👀 I’m interested in learning; old dog/new tricks, even how to use GitHub. ;-)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to learn mac/iOS apps
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on anything with folks who are interested in helping others at least as much as helping themselves.
- 📫 How to reach me? I'm assuming for now you can reach me via GitHub
